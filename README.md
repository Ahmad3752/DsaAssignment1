Problem 1
Approach
In Task 1, I implemented a circular linked list by creating nodes and adding them at the tail. I broke down the task into smaller parts and set mini-goals, which made the task time-consuming but relatively easier to manage. This approach allowed for a clearer focus on each component of the problem.
Challenges Faced
The main challenge arose in the core of the task, particularly in the ProcessTime function, where I used nested loops. This complexity made the implementation a bit tedious. However, I successfully navigated through it, and overcoming this challenge enhanced my problem-solving skills.
Assumptions
In Task 1, there were no significant assumptions. However, I assumed that the linked list would be circular while still using both head and tail pointers. Although it seems somewhat awkward, this design choice improves the readability and ease of implementation.

Problem 2
Approach
In Task 2, I have not yet completed the entire task. I managed to create chunks of a number and store them in a linked list, but I only checked if a single chunk was a prime number. For this, I implemented the Miller-Rabin test.
Challenges Faced
This task presented numerous challenges. First, I successfully solved the problem of storing a 1024-bit number. However, the major concern was checking whether the number was prime

Conclusion
This assignment enhanced my understanding of linked lists and the complexities involved in working with large numbers. I look forward to completing Task 2 and overcoming the challenges associated with prime number checking.
